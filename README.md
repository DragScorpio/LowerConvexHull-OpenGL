Finding Upper Envelope of Lines with Lower Convex Hull Trick + Visualization

How to run:
  User can draw any many lines as possible by clicking two points to generate each line in the frame. After completed, hit ENTER to let the program calculate the upper envelope of these lines.

Theory:
  The upper envelope of lines in primal plane can be mapped to the lower convex hull of points in the dual plane. Suppose we have line equation: y = ax - b, in the primal plane, then the dual of this plane is a point in dual plane: (a, b).
